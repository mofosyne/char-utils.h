Small C utility library macros and functions for char handling.
e.g. conversion or checks for hex, digits and ascii values

You are encourage to copy and paste snippets as you need in your project,
but you can install it as a normal C header file as well!

Note that some of these macro already have a C standard library equvalent,
so you are encourage to use C standard library function for portability.

## Usage

The library consists of one header file, easily integrated into your project manually or via [clib](https://github.com/clibs/clib)

```bash
clib install mofosyne/char-utils.h
```

or copy these files manually to your source folder:

```bash
char-utils.h
```
